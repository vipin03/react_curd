# react_curd
Learning react.<br>
In this example i have used react-bootstrap-table2 and Axios.<br>
<br>
Created two components : form and table.<br>
Learned : How to pass data from root to child components using props. Using axios for geting and saving data with api(currently in php). Calling parent methods from child using bind.<br>
<br><br>

NOTE: Api is build with php for temporary purpose and change api url in used in axios.
